But this little outlet in the busy walkway at the first floor of Select City Mall will introduce you to an entire unexplored range of flavoured popcorns. The menu is exquisite and caters to both sweet and spice loving taste buds. The staff is patient and sporty enough to let you taste various flavours before you settle for your pick. After tasting a couple of flavours, we settled for the the Dark Chocolate Overload and Classic Pizza K...","id":"27017524","rating_color":"5BA829","review_time_friendly":"3 days ago","rating_text":"Great!","timestamp":1462712575,"likes":1,"user":{"name":"Tariq Shakeel","zomato_handle":"tariqshungerzone","foodie_level":"Big Foodie","foodie_level_num":4,"foodie_color":"ffae4f","profile_url":"https:\/\/www.zomato.com\/tariqshungerzone?utm_source=api_basic_user&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=v2.1","profile_image":"https:\/\/p1.zmtcdn.com\/image\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/d22\/1191a4d6dcc4492d0bb31eabec82ad22_100_thumb.jpg","profile_deeplink":"zomato:\/\/u\/27900531"},"comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":5,"review_text":"Ordered their popcorn as baby announcement gifts. Got the chocolate, wasabi and caramel flavours! Not only were the guys at Crunchbox extremely responsive and helpful, they delivered 750 tins of popcorn without a single glitch. The popcorn of course is fantastic and there is really no comparison to it (I tried and compared all before picking CrunchBox)!\u00a0Great stuff. Will surely be a regular customer!","id":"26963947","rating_color":"305D02","review_time_friendly":"10 days ago","rating_text":"Insane!","timestamp":1462177934,"likes":0,"user":{"name":"Gaurav Mehta","foodie_level":"Foodie","foodie_level_num":2,"foodie_color":"ffd35d","profile_url":"https:\/\/www.zomato.com\/users\/gaurav-mehta-52658?utm_source=api_basic_user&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=v2.1","profile_image":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/images\/zavatar_200_1x.png","profile_deeplink":"zomato:\/\/u\/52658"},"comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":5,"review_text":"Wasn't sure of the idea of trying out flavoured pop-corns, but regret not trying them out earlier. Had the Dark chocolate & Smokehouse BBQ flavors and simply loved them.  We ended up ordering huge quantities and they had vanished in our stomachs within an hour. Irresistible!!\u00a0  Its a pocket friendly place, so will be back soon to try the other flavours out, if I am left with space after the ones I tried earlier - especially dark chocolate!!","id":"26855298","rating_color":"305D02","review_time_friendly":"22 days ago","rating_text":"Insane!","timestamp":1461123779,"likes":1,"user":{"name":"Sandeep Singh","foodie_level":"Big Foodie","foodie_level_num":6,"foodie_color":"ffae4f","profile_url":"https:\/\/www.zomato.com\/users\/sandeep-singh-29659368?utm_source=api_basic_user&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=v2.1","profile_image":"https:\/\/p1.zmtcdn.com\/image\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/1eb\/4d6d70b9e2cbc42c926c4214bf8c31eb_100_thumb.jpg","profile_deeplink":"zomato:\/\/u\/29659368"},"comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":4,"review_text":"This is definitely the place to rush to on a day when u crave something satiating - especially on a day when u need to gorge on something sweet.   We tried the smokehouse bbq flavour and the dark chocolate one ... Being a hardcore dark chocolate lover - this place took me by surprise - the dark chocolate popcorns were divine! The smokehouse bbq was also delicious in its own subtle ways.   The pricing is super easy on the pocket and this place is my quick fix from now on on eves when i crave dark...","id":"26854673","rating_color":"5BA829","review_time_friendly":"22 days ago","rating_text":"Great!","timestamp":1461112090,"likes":2,"user":{"name":"Vasundhara Sharma","foodie_level":"Big Foodie","foodie_level_num":5,"foodie_color":"ffae4f","profile_url":"https:\/\/www.zomato.com\/users\/vasundhara-sharma-3046757?utm_source=api_basic_user&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=v2.1","profile_image":"https:\/\/p1.zmtcdn.com\/image\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/c48\/d7a813fade80efb64e470a004e623c48_100_thumb.jpg","profile_deeplink":"zomato:\/\/u\/3046757"},"comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":4.5,"review_text":"My favourite spot for the best popcorn in  Delhi. Limited flavours does create a drawback but then each flavour is a packet of 10 other flavours, thus balancing the variety issue. My personal favourite being wasabi and minty indian.
